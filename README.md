ðŸŽ¥ Face Recognition Attendance System
This project is a real-time face recognition-based attendance system that uses your webcam to detect and recognize faces, and automatically marks attendance in a CSV file. It leverages deep learning-based facial recognition for accurate and efficient identification.

ðŸ§  How It Works
Face Encoding Generator:
A script scans through a given dataset of labeled images (sorted by folders named after each person), extracts facial features (encodings), and saves them in a pickle file for later use.

Real-Time Face Recognition:
Another script opens the webcam, detects faces frame by frame, matches them against the known encodings, and marks the user as present by recording their name with a timestamp in a .csv file. A name is marked only once per session.

Visualization:
The system draws bounding boxes around detected faces and displays their names directly on the video feed in real-time.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
dataset/ â€” Folder containing subfolders of known individuals' images

encodings.pickle â€” Serialized face encodings and corresponding names

attendance2.csv â€” File where attendance is logged

Main script â€” Handles webcam input, face recognition, and attendance logging

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
face-recognition â€” Core library for face detection and encoding

dlib â€” Underlying face recognition engine

OpenCV â€” Used for capturing video, drawing boxes, and displaying output

NumPy â€” Array manipulation and distance calculations

pickle â€” Serializing and deserializing encodings

datetime â€” For timestamping attendance logs

âœ… Features
Real-time face detection and recognition

Automatic attendance logging

Session-aware logging to avoid duplicate entries

Easy to extend with more individuals by adding images to the dataset

ðŸš€ Use Cases
Classroom or lab attendance

Office employee check-in systems

Secure access logs for events or clubs

This project is a solid starting point for anyone exploring facial recognition or automating identity-based tasks with computer vision.
